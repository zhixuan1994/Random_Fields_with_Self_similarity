## Abstract
As an extension of self-similar stochastic processes to high-dimension, the self-similar random fields hold significant research value in the study of random fields. 
Given the limited availability of relevant literature, we propose a method for simulating sample paths of self-similar second-order random fields. 
This simulation algorithm is based on the Lamperti transformation, which bridges $H$-self-similar processes and stationary processes. 
Our simulation method is inspired by the one for simulating self-similar processes, provided by Ding et al. (2024). 
As successful applications, we implement this method to simulate fractional Brownian field, sub-fractional Brownian field, and bi-fractional Brownian field. Among the above random fields, our framework gives the first definition of the bi-fractional Brownian field in literature. 
We also propose a rigorous test of a class of self-similar Gaussian fields.  
Using this test on the above simulated Gaussian random fields, we show the consistency of our simulation algorithms.
